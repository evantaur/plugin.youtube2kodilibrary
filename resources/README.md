# plugin.youtube2kodilibrary
YouTube channels to KODI

###### API key

You'll need YouTube API key for this to work, a good guide would be:
https://github.com/jdf76/plugin.video.youtube/wiki/Personal-API-Keys

if you have set custom api key for YouTube addon you should be able to skip this part.

###### Video source
use:
**special://profile/library/series**
and for information provider **choose local information only** <-- This is important unless you want shows like Stargate randomly appearing to your library.
